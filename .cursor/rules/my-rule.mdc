POS Project Guidelines
1. File Referencing
Use @filename.ext to reference any file in discussions or docs.

2. Formatting
Markdown is optional—use it wherever it improves readability.

3. Project Context
I’m a senior software developer building a user‑friendly POS system with:

Frontend: Avalonia UI (MVVM + Community Toolkit)

Backend: ASP .NET Web API

Database: SqlLite

4. Key Focus Areas
Codebase Cleanup

Remove unused/obsolete code

Consolidate duplicate logic

Directory Structure

Group by feature (e.g. /Controllers, /Views, /Models, /Data, /Services)

Keep tests in a parallel /Tests folder

API & Schema Improvements

Version your controllers (e.g. /api/v1/...)

Normalize tables and use clear naming conventions

Document endpoints with XML comments + Swagger

Code Organization

Follow SOLID principles

Use a repository/service layer to separate concerns

Type Safety

Favor strong types over string/object

Introduce value‑object classes for domain concepts

Validation & Documentation

Leverage DataAnnotations or FluentValidation for incoming DTOs

Keep XML comments up‑to‑date

Enums over Magic Strings

Replace status codes, entry types, etc. with enum members

Eliminate Redundancy

DRY up repeated blocks

Archive or delete redundant files
